<h3> Habits That Make You Age Faster and Look Older</h3> 
The Following Habits Makes You Look Older<br>

<h5>1. Smoking</h5><br>

<p>It is a known fact that smoking harms your health in many ways. 
But smoking can also accelerate the aging process of your skin.</p><br>

<h5>2. Drinking in Excess </h5><br>
<p> Alcohol is a natural diuretic, so when you drink in excess it 
uses dehydration. 
Dehydration depletes the natural moisture from you
 skin, which automatically makes you look older than your age.<br>
 High alcohol intake is even associated with skin cancer.</p><br>
<h5> 3. Holding Grudges</p></h5>
<p>Forgiveness is something most of us believe in,
 but we donâ€™t always practice it. Holding grudges against any person or
 situation is not good for your health as well as appearance.<br>
  If you are not able to forgive,
   you are adding more stress to your life, 
   which boosts your level of the hormone cortisol.
    Cortisol leads to weight gain, 
    high blood pressure and high blood sugar.

<br>Stress even leads to more frowning,
 one of the key causes of wrinkles on the forehead.<br>

<h5>4. Sun Exposure </h5><br>
<p> 
No matter how amazing the sun feels on your body,
 regular and prolonged exposure to sunrays is one
  of the worst things you can do for your skin.

<br>Long-term exposure to harmful ultraviolet (UV)
 rays of the sun weakens your skin cells and blood vessels,
  which causes a tanned, leathery-looking skin. It even leads
   to pigmentation,
 reduced skin elasticity and a degradation of skin texture.</p><br>
<h5>5. Too Little Sleep </h5><br>
<p>Just one night of bad sleep can make you look and feel tired.
 It can even lead to dark circles and bags under your eyes.
  Now, imagine 
what lack of sleep for days can do to your skin appearance. </p><br>
