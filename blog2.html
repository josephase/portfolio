 <h3> Top 5 Benefits Of Coconut Water</h3> 
   <h5> 1. Rehydrates the Body</h5>
<img src="coconut.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="image">
<p>Coconut water is an excellent thirst quencher to beat tropical 
summer thirst. Because of its electrolyte composition, 
coconut water is also used to rehydrate the body in case
 of dehydration and fluid loss due to diarrhea,
  vomiting or excessive sweating. 
  A good source of carbohydrates,
   it also helps lift your energy level. <br>
   In addition to boosting rehydration, 
   coconut water is also easy on the stomach and 
   thus is used to soothe tummy troubles like indigestion, 
   acid reflux and gastroenteritis.<br></p>
<h5> 2. Lowers Blood Pressure</h5><br>
<p> 
Coconut water is considered good for controlling high blood pressure, 
thanks to its vitamin C, 
potassium and magnesium content. Potassium, in particular, 
helps lower blood pressure by balancing 
out the negative effects of sodium.<br>
To help reduce high blood pressure, 
drink a cup of fresh coconut water twice a day.
 Bottled coconut water, however, 
 may not be very beneficial as may be high in sodium.</p>
<h5>3. Heart Tonic</h5><br>
<p> Cholesterol- and fat-free 
tender coconut water offers cardioprotective benefits.
 It helps lower low-density 
 lipoprotein (LDL or the ‘bad’ cholesterol)
  and increase high-density lipoprotein 
  (HDL or the ‘good’ cholesterol) levels, 
thus reducing the risk of heart disease.<br>
It helps reduce plaque formation in the arteries
 and lowers the risk of heart attacks and strokes. </p><br>
<h5>4. Treats Headaches </h5><br>
<p> Most headaches, even migraines, are triggered by dehydration.
 In such cases, coconut water can be of great he
 in supplying electrolytes to the body and boosting hydration.<BR>
 Coconut water is also rich in magnesium.
  People who suffer from migraines often have 
  low levels of magnesium. Magnesium can help reduce frequency of migraine attacks</p><br>
<h5>5. Regulates Blood Sugar</h5><br>


<p>Coconut
 water contains amino acids and dietary fiber
 that help regulate
  blood sugar and improve insulin sensitivity.<br>

It also helps with common issues 
faced by people who have diabetes.
<br> It helps manage your weight.<br>
 As it helps improve circulation, coconut water 
 is also good for reducing symptoms like
 numbness in feet and a tendency to develop atherosclerosis.</p><br>
